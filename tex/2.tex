\begin{document}
We know that $f_{g}(t)=k_{3}z_{1}(t)p_{kp}(t)$. In both situation,
the pressure of the high pressure stock is the same, so the ratio
$\frac{f_{g}(t)}{k_{3}z_{1}(t)}$ is constant.

We search $z_{1}^{*}(t)$ such that the flow into the turbine is increasing
by 3 kg/s\\
\begin{align*}
\frac{f_{g}(t)}{k_{3}z_{1}(t)} & =\frac{f_{g}(t)+3}{k_{3}z_{1}^{*}(t)}\\
z_{1}^{*}(t)f_{g}(t) & =z_{1}(t)\left(f_{g}(t)+3\right)\\
\end{align*}
\\
Initially we have $z_{1}(t)=1$ which implies that $z_{1}^{*}(t)f_{g}(t)=f_{g}(t)+3\Rightarrow z_{1}^{*}(t)=1+\frac{3}{f_{g}(t)}$.
The flow in the turbine was around $37$kg/s, so the new value of
the opening valve is $1.027$
